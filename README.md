this project is made by me while studying in purpose of monitoring a VoIP
in Cisco Call Manager Express i got the inspiration to create this plugin 
in Bash scripting because i haven't found plugin that monitor SCCP protocol 
in nagios

Use:
copy and past the plugin in the nagios directory under /usr/local/nagios/libexec
add a few editing in command.cfg file and the router.cfg file
reload the nagios service 
enjoy!!
